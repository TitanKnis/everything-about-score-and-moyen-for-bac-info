importance ranking in moyen
ranking : subject (difference it makes in moyen between 0 and 20 in the subject)
1 : math (3.75)
2 : algorithm technical (2.812)
3 : physique (2.5)
4 : TIC (1.875) / BD (1.875)
5 :  Arabic (1.25) / English (1.25)
/ french (1.25) / philo (1.25) / sport (1.25)
/deutsch (.625*)
6 : algorithm practical (0.938)

Important !! :
* : because Deutsch only apply from 10 to 20
instead of from 0 to 20 like philo/ Arabic/
sport/English/French it has half the difference of the fifth ranking (half 1.25 = (0.625) )even though it is just as important and can substitute for missing points from any of the fifth ranking subjects
Example :
if moyen = 10
- 20 in deutsch can substitute for 0 in philo.
- 15 in deutsch can substitute for 5 in Arabic.
- 13 in deutsch can substitute for 7 in sport.
but from 0 to 10 in deutsch it doesn't make any difference

Important !! :
if you add up all the subjects differences it equals to (20.625)
###(deutsch (0.625))###
but without Deutsch it equals to (20)
so it is quite exact.

PS:
BD=base de donnes
TIC=تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصال التطبيقي
moyen = Academic average in BAC

you don't fall because of deutsch but it can add if you get 20/20 about (0.625) in moyen
if default moyen=10
so 10 became 10.625
and if you get 0/20 up to 10/20 in deutsch your moyen will still be (10)
