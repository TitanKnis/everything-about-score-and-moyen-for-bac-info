importance ranking in score
ranking : subject (difference it makes in score between 0 and 20 in the subject)
1 : math (45)
2 : algorithm technical (41.24)
3 : English (25) / french (25)
4 : physique (20)
5 : TIC (12.5) / BD  (12.5)
6 : philo(5)/Arabic(5)/sport(5)/ deutsch (2.5*)
7 : algorithm practical (3.76)


Important !! :
* : because Deutsch only apply from 10 to 20
instead of from 0 to 20 like philo/ Arabic/
sport it has half the difference of the sixth ranking (half 5 = (2.5) )even though it is just as important and can substitute for missing points from any of the sixth ranking subjects
Example :
if moyen = 10
- 20 in deutsch can substitute for 0 in philo.
- 15 in deutsch can substitute for 5 in Arabic.
- 13 in deutsch can substitute for 7 in sport.
but from 0 to 10 in deutsch it doesn't make any difference

Important !! :
if you add up all the subjects differences it equals to (202.5)
###(deutsch (2.5))###
but without Deutsch it equals to (200)
so it is quite exact.

PS:
BD=base de donnes
TIC=تكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصال التطبيقي

you don't fall because of deutsch but it can add if you get 20/20 about (0.625) in moyen
so 10 became 10.625
and if you get 0/20 up to 10/20 in deutsch your moyen will still be (10).
